# Kaggle_Titanic_Project
In this repository, I created ML algorithms to the Kaggle Competition about Titanic data at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

First version of the algorithms is Logistic Regression. I would like to continue with:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- K Means Clustering
etc.

The libraries that I used in this project are:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Cufflinks
- Plotly
- Scikitlearn

 The Python version is 3.8.10
 
 The changes will be explained in this README file.
