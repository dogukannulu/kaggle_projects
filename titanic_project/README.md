# Overview
In this repository, I created ML algorithms to the Kaggle Competition about [Titanic data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

First version of the algorithms is Logistic Regression.

The libraries that I used in this project are:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Cufflinks
- Plotly
- Scikitlearn
